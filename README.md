# Multi-fingered gripper

Low-cost open-source 3D-printed reconfigurable multi-fingered gripper. Central to the design is the robotic finger module, which utilizes a single motor. A manual reconfigurable board supports multiple finger configurations, such as two-finger and three-finger setups.

## Description

This repository contains 3D models and guides for printing these models, including recommended materials and printer settings. It also includes a detailed list of required hardware and tools, step-by-step instructions for assembly. A control software written in Matlab along with a user manual is included.

### 3D Models and Printing Guides

Detailed descriptions of each 3D model available in this project and instructions for printing, including:
- Recommended materials
- Printer settings

### Assembly Instructions w/ the Bill of Materials

A complete list of all necessary materials, tools, and components required to build and run the project. This includes hardware components, motors, and other accessories. Step-by-step guide on how to assemble the components of the project.

### Software and Control

This project uses Matlab for control and automation. Included in this repository are:
